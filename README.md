# What is a diceware password?
A diceware password is generated by rolling five dice and using the resulting string to pick a word from a word list. These passwords are easy for humans to memorize, but are secure because of their length. This generator will create six words per password.

# Is this really random if itâ€™s a computer?
Python uses the Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number generator. This is the most commonly used pseudorandom number generator and is random enough for these purposes. Thrown dice can be accurately predicted given all parameters are known, making algorithmic generation viable. The real strength of a diceware password is in the length and memorability. 

# Running the script

`python3 diceware.py`

From the terminal, navigate to the `diceware_password` directory and run `diceware.py`. This will bring up a prompt asking how many passwords should be generated. Enter a number and press `enter`.
